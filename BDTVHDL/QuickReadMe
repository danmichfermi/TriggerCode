Quick Readme (Made much later) 

2 basic components:

1. Shell code assembly FPGA's
2. Memory file assembly

Different sets of shell codes are based around different hardware arrangements. 
The shell code and memory file codes


1- Code is based around some local names which should be edited. The code also is based around certain BDT arrangements or 
tree numbers with depths. The code could be changed in order to massively increase the flexibility but there are diminishing
returns. Pay attention to the output/input rules based on how FPGA's are programmed. Current mode was tested by reading memory
addressess or values. Some portions were changed to hard coded pieces in order to simply pieces to ensure accuracy and testability in the short term. 

2- Memory file assemblies and modes are based around the number of trees again. 2 basic modes are readily implemented. 
Addition bash code could be employed to simplify tasks and move components around automatically.
