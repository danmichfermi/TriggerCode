<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_counter14.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_counter14.vhd". The design "lpm_counter14.vhd" is a 6 bit up counter. The counter has a synchronous set signal, that sets the counter to 32. </P>
