<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_counter13.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_counter13.vhd". The design "lpm_counter13.vhd" is a 26 bit up counter. The counter has a synchronous set signal, that sets the counter to 33554432. </P>
